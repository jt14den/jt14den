### Hi, I'm Tim! I lead the [Data Science Center at UCLA Library](https://uclalibrary.github.io/dsc/) and co-lead our [Open Source Program Office](https://www.ucop.edu/open-source-program-office/)

- 📊 I support researchers and students through consulting, workshops, and infrastructure—especially around [UCLA Dataverse](https://dataverse.ucla.edu), FAIR data, and computational research
- 🧑‍🏫 I teach with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and help develop open lessons, including recent ones on [computational thinking](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-computational-thinking/) and open science for librarians
- 🌐 I collaborate across the [UC OSPO Network](https://ucop.edu/open-source-program-office/) and help guide education efforts and curriculum design
- 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 I’m lucky to work with amazing student researchers in the [UCLA DataSquad](https://ucla-datasquad.github.io/), who’ve contributed to projects from 3D data visualization to civic data investigations
- 🎸 Outside work, I play guitar, explore local trails, and tinker with Raspberry Pis and homebrew tech setups
